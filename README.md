*Introduction to R* worshop material
==================================

This workshop material is based on [Bay area blues: the effect of the housing crisis][bay-area-blues], chapter in [Beautiful Data](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Data-Stories-Elegant-Solutions/dp/0596157118), by Hadley Wickham, David Poole and Deborah F Swayne.

Original code from Hadley and coauthors can be accessed from their [github repository](https://github.com/hadley/sfhousing). I have modified the code to fit more into the workshop setting. I have also updated the code to work with up to date libraries.

The R basics are based on [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley. The book itself is great resource learning modern R.

## Getting started
I recommend using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) for working with R. It's a great IDE which makes R programming easier especially for new R programmers.

[Follow RStudio installation installation instructions](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

To start working through the tutorial clone this git repository locally.
Whole environment should get setup once you load it in RStudio. It is an good idea to create an RStudio project from this repository ([read how to do it](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)).
