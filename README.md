*Introduction to R* worshop material
==================================

This workshop material is based on [Bay area blues: the effect of the housing crisis][bay-area-blues], chapter in [Beautiful Data](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Data-Stories-Elegant-Solutions/dp/0596157118), by Hadley Wickham, David Poole and Deborah F Swayne.

Original code from Hadley and coauthors can be accessed from their [github repository](https://github.com/hadley/sfhousing). I have modified the code to fit more into the workshop setting. I have also updated the code to work with up to date libraries.
